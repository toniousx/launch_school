input:
- loan amount
- Annual percentage rate
- loan duration(months)

output:
- monthly interest rate
- loan duration in months
- monthly payment

formula
m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

month_paym = loan_amount * (month_int_r / (1 - (1 + month_int_r)**(-loan_dur)))

I want to know how much I will pay every month for my loan.
From the loan amount I asked depends from the month interest
rate from the total exponencially related to the loan duration
