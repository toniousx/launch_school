=begin
1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
## casual pseudocode
we initialize a method who has 2 integer arguments
we initialize the variable result and inside we add the first argument
adding the sum operator continued by the second argument
we print the result variable
we close the method
invoke the method passing two integers
we have the result

## formal pseudocode
START
SET sum_of_integers method
SET first argument
SET second argument
inside the variable
SET result as the first integer plus the second integer
PRINT result
END
GET sum_of_integers with two integers as arguments
PRINT result as last ruby linde inside the method
END of program

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
those strings concatenated together
##casual pseudocode

we initialize a method called concatenator
we set an argument as an array of strings
we use a method to take each string and to concatenate saving the concatenation
to one variable
we call puts to print the variable as last line of the code inside the method.
we return the value
we close the method
we invoke the method with a varieble of strings as argument

##formal pseudocode
START
SET method concatenator
SET argument as array of strings
WHILE passing from the array each string
GET the output from the iteration to a new variable result
PRINT result variable
END
GET concatenator with an array of strings an argument
PRINT result
END of program

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with
every other element
##casual pseudocode
We initialize a method new_random_ary_creator with an array of integers as
argument
inside the method we initialize a new array
we iterate from the original array generating random elements that are different
from this array cheking there is a new element adding eache element to the new
array.
we print the new array
we end the method.
We call the method
we have a printed result
##formal pseudocode
START program
SET method new_random_ary_creator
SET argument  that will be an array of integers
SET a new array
WHILE each item of array of integers we creat a random item who is different to
all of the itemes contained inside this array
GET the item and add each item inside of the new array
GET the new array as the result
END program
GET method new_random_ary_creator with array of integers
GET the new array as result
ENF of program
end=
