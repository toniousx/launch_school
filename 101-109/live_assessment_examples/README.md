The asssesemnt consists in:
- 2 problems in 1 hour ( medium in The sile of small problems and level 5-6 in Codewars)
- Each problem should take 35 min max. But better 25-30min.
Rules:
- We can usea a PEDAc template
- We can't use Ruby documentation

Recomendations:
- Use PEDAC even you think is easy and specially if is hard (70% is the knowledge and 30% is the nerves/stress insecurity)
- Encapsulate in methods the behaviors. It will be easier to test and read and harder to make mistakes (recomended, but not a must)
- Test every line you can test(baby steps).
- Be sure that you are solving the right problem (test the exmaples or create easier ones)
- Find the easies examples you can find to test the methos helper methdods and each lines of code and maybe some edge cases as examples(but is not a must)
- Talk with the interviewer, explain waht you are ogingi to do as "I want to call the map method and pass the argument to transform it and return `x`"

Other thinks to take in count:
- In case we have a question ask the interviewer.
- If the interviewer considerates that needs to help you and/or you need help because you are struggling, then will help but
will affect the final grade.
