**Question 1**

Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the same object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."

    a_inner = a_outer

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id 
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id
```

All initialized variables all are pointing to a new object id except `d_outer`.
`d_outer` takes the object Id of the first collection object `a_outer` (`42` in this
case) because an integer is inmutable, `a_outer` and `d_outer` will point to the same
object_id.

*Notice that Ruby re-used the "42 object with id 85" when the value was the same.*

```ruby
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id
```
We initialize `outer_inner_id` local inner scope variables and pointing to the same objects from each `_outer_id`.

*Notice that Ruby did NOT change the id for any of the objects between outside and inside the block*
```ruby
    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]
```
We reassign all `_outer` variables to a new object the var. now alle are
pointing to another place in memory.


```ruby
    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
    puts


    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]
```

now all `_inner` are pointing again to the same object but this time with the new
objects values all `_outer`.

*Notice that changing the values has forced Ruby to create new objects and refer to them with the original variable names.*


```ruby
    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts
  end

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts

  ```
  As we can see Id's are different from `_outer_id` before and after the block

  *Notice that Ruby re-uses the objects under the hood when it can, but uses different ones for different values.*
  ```ruby

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```
`_inner` variables were initialized inside the block. This is why we can't access outside and there are all raising `undefined value or method` exceptions.

*Notice that once we leave the block, those variables that were defined inside the block lose their meaning.*

**Question 2**
Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."

It will happen exactly the same as Question 1 until we reassign arguments `_outer`(`a_outer= 22, b_outer="thithy tree"...`) (but not local variables `_outer`!) now `_outer` as arguments points to different objects of `_outer` as outer local variables.

*Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object id's down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!*

*This is because our method call accepts VALUES as arguments. The names we give to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from any other use of those same names.*

*We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build some suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as easily have called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred instead of a_outer.*

*The method gets the VALUES of the arguments we pass, but the parameter variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside of the method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.*

**Question 3**
Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as arguments and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

`my_string` and `a_string_param` argument are pointing to the same object
until we reassign `a_string_param` inside the method.
then my_string in one line before the last will be `"pumpkins"`

`my_array` and `an_array_param` argument are pointing to the same object
and will be also in the end.
Because we don't reassign inside the method and we mutate `an_array_param` will still point both to the same object.
then my_string in one line before the last will be `"["pumpkins", nrutabaga"]"`

*Our output will look like this:*

```ruby
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
```

*Why? It seems clear from the above that Ruby treats string and array arguments differently...but not so fast. Actually the arguments are treated in exactly the same way...but the results are different.*

*In both cases, Ruby passes the arguments "by value", but unlike some other languages, the value that gets passed is a reference to some object. The string argument is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type String. Similarly, the array is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type Array.*

*The important distinction is that while a reference is passed, the method initializes a new local variable for both the string and the array and assigns each reference to the new local variables. These are variables that only live within the scope of the method definition.*

*So, if both arguments live inside the method as a new variable that stores a reference to the passed object...why don't the string and the array behave the same way in our output?*

*The difference lies in what Ruby does when the program executes either a String`#+=` operation or an Array `#<<` operation.*

*The `String#+=` operation is re-assignment and creates a new String object. The reference to this new object is assigned to a_string_param. The local variable a_string_param now points to "pumpkinsrutabaga", not "pumpkins". It has been re-assigned by the String#+= operation. This means that a_string_param and my_string no longer point to the same object.*

*With the array, one array object can have any number of elements. When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.*

*So, because the local variable an_array_param still points to the original object, the local variables my_array and an_array_param are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.*
</details>
</br>

**Question 4**
To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

```ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

In this case

`My string looks like this now:  pumpkinsrutabaga`
`My array looks like this now:  ["pumpkins"]`

Same reason as above.
The imporant part is what is doing the method or the reassigment.
`#<<` Is mutating the object appending `rutabaga`
`=` Is reassigining and then `an_array_param` points
to another object. Then will not affect my_array local
variable.

*As you can see, we have achieved the opposite effect from our last example.*

*We are still passing in the same two string and array arguments, but the results are the opposite, because our method does the "same thing" to each, but in a different way than before. That is, in both cases, the method attempts to change the string from "pumpkins" to "pumpkinsrutabaga" and add "rutabaga" to the array.*

*Despite the similarity of the results inside the method definition, the results outside the method definition are the opposite.*

*As before, the explanation is all about what Ruby does with local variables when we change the object it points to. Does it create a new local variable? Or is it able to just modify the existing object?*

*With the Array#= assignment, our literal ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] array is a new object, and we are assigning it to the local variable an_array_param.*
</details>
</br>


**Question 5**
Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

`"My string looks like this now: pumpkins`
`My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]`
```

Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.

How can we change this code to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
result:
puts "My string looks like this now:"
puts "My array looks like this now: "

One method one responsibility:
- In case we want to display a change in the string/array
- In case we want to mutate/update the array/array

```ruby
def display_rutabaga_inside(a_string_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  puts a_string_param
end
```

```ruby
def append_rutabaga_and_update(an_array_param)
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end
```

my_string = display_rutabaga_inside(my_string)
my_array = display_rutabaga_inside(my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

*OR*

```ruby
def not_so_tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]

  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
my_string, my_array = not_so_tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

*Every language (Ruby included) provides ways and means of writing "clever" code that depends on some of the less obvious traits of the language.*

*Every good programmer practices these tricks...and then avoids them like the plague.*

*Clever programmers don't write "clever" code. They write explicit code that is easy to read, debug and modify as the requirements change.*

*Question 6*
How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

*Ruby will automatically evaluate statements, so the method above can be significantly simplified by changing it to just:*

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
```
*Both of these methods do exactly the same thing - but one is much more complex to read.*
