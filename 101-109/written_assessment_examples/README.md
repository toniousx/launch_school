#### Written assesement consists in:

- **20 questions in 3 hours**
  - **max 9 min per question!**
  - between **6 min to 7** is **ok**.
    - **6 min** will give 33% extra time **1hr** of the 2hr **to re-check** answers.
    - **7 min** will give **40 min to re-check**.
    - **8 min** will give only **20 minutes to re-check**,
- Are precise and specific questions
- They expect 20 precise and specific answers in less than 3 hrs.
- **It we take more than 3 hrs to submit. It will affect the final note.**


#### Recomendations:
##### Have multiple timers:
1. Total time to final wrap up **2:55** (5 minutes before the 3 hrs)
2. **1 hr time** (then should be around the **half or more of the 20 questions solved**).
3. **6 min alarm timer for each question plus 2 more min of extra time(8 max)**.
4. Have a **paper to write about pending exercises and/or observations to come back** once we solved the 20 **to check on the extra time**.

#### Other recomendations:
- **answer exactly what they ask**, the ***output/return will be the reason why of your explanation***
- **first** write **about initializations**
- **second** about **method calls**
- **third** to **method definitions**
- **fourth** we have the result and we know the mutation/reassigment be pragmatic and **see if** we need to continue or is **enough to answer to the question/s**.  ***(For this reason line `x` outputs `y` and returns `z`.)***


#### To take in count:

######Grade	Meaning	Percent
**A+	aced, perfect score	98-100
A	  good, minor errors	93-97
A-	some errors, but ok	90-92
B+	some errors, needs improvement	88-89
B	  many errors, needs improvement	83-87**
B-	poor effort, needs improvement	80-82

**Scores below B are not passing. So less 83% of false answers will be a "not yet" and then we need to repeat the exam.**
